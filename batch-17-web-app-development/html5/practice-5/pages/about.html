    <h1>About Me – Asad Memon: Flutter Developer, Data Analyst Trainee & Aspiring Web App Developer</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Asad Memon, a passionate Flutter Developer with a keen interest in both mobile app development and
        backend solutions. I have a strong foundation in creating dynamic, user-friendly apps and strive to always learn
        and adapt to new technologies. Currently, I’m enrolled in the Data Analysis Certificate program by Google, and
        I’m also expanding my knowledge in Web App Development through my course at SMIT.

        In my journey as a developer, I’ve had the privilege to lead teams, collaborate with talented professionals, and
        work on exciting projects. I’ve helped build both e-commerce prototypes and custom solutions for clients, always
        ensuring seamless communication between the front-end and back-end teams. At the moment, I’m diving deep into
        Python Django for backend development and Flutter for front-end applications, making sure to deliver smooth,
        responsive, and reliable user experiences.

        This portfolio site is not just a showcase of my work but also an assignment from SMIT, marking an important
        milestone in my career. Take a look at my projects, and feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect or
        collaborate.</p>
