    <h2>🍳 Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Marinate the Chicken (at least 1 hour or overnight):</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, mix chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, lemon
        <br>juice, and salt. Cover and refrigerate.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Cook the Rice:</h3>
    <p>Bring 8 cups of water to boil with whole spices and salt. Add soaked rice. Boil till 70–80% cooked (the grains
        <br>should still have a bite). Drain and set aside.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Biryani Masala Base:</h3>
    <p>In a heavy-bottomed pot or large pan, heat oil/ghee.
        <br>
        <br>Add sliced onions and fry until golden brown and crisp. Remove half for <br>layering.
        <br>
        <br>Add tomatoes, green chilies, and cook till soft.
        <br>
        <br>Add marinated chicken and cook until it's 80% done.
        <br>
        <br>Add chopped mint and coriander, and biryani masala.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Layer the Biryani:</h3>
    <p><b>In the same pot or a separate heavy pan, layer:</b>
        <br>
        <br><i>Half of the chicken masala
            <br>
            <br>Half the rice
            <br>
            <br>Some fried onions, mint, coriander, and a drizzle of saffron milk (if using)
            <br>
            <br>Repeat with remaining chicken and rice.</i>
    </p>

    <h3>5. Dum Cooking (Steaming):</h3>
    <p>Seal the pot with a tight lid (or dough) and cook on low heat for 25–30 minutes.
        <br>
        <br>Alternatively, place a tawa (griddle) under the pot to prevent burning.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Rest and Serve:</h3>
    <p>Let it rest for 10 minutes after cooking. Gently fluff with a fork. Serve hot with raita or salan.</p>
